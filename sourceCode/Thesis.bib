abstract = {Adhesion of microorganisms to various interfaces has been explained by the classical Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory of colloid stability. The theory has been used as a qualitative model, but also in a quantitative way to calculate adhesion free energy changes involved in microbial adhesion. In this paper some important investigations will be review that show how the DLVO theory is used in microbiology, mainly for bacteria. Other models have also been developed in order to predict adhesion, such as the thermodynamic approach and later the extended DLVO theory. These will be discussed in relation to the 'classical' DLVO theory. The theories assume that microbial cells behave as inert particles. The implications that follow from the fact that they are biologically active and have heterogeneous cell surfaces will also be exemplified and discussed. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, we have been developing techniques for high-speed 3D shape measurement using digital fringe projection and phase-shifting techniques: various algorithms have been developed to improve the phase computation speed, parallel programming has been employed to further increase the processing speed, and advanced hardware technologies have been adopted to boost the speed of coordinate calculations and 3D geometry rendering. We have successfully achieved simultaneous 3D absolute shape acquisition, reconstruction, and display at a speed of 30 frames/s with 300 K points per frame. This paper presents the principles of the real-time 3D shape measurement techniques that we developed, summarizes the most recent progresses that have been made in this field, and discusses the challenges for advancing this technology further. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this article, the current status of membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology for wastewater treatment is reviewed. Fundamental facets of the MBR process and membrane and process configurations are outlined and the advantages and disadvantages over conventional suspended growth-based biotreatment are briefly identified. Key process design and operating parameters are defined and their significance explained. The inter-relationships between these parameters are identified and their implications discussed, with particular reference to impacts on membrane surface fouling and channel clogging. In addition, current understanding of membrane surface fouling and identification of candidate foulants is appraised. Although much interest in this technology exists and its penetration of the market will probably increase significantly, there remains a lack of understanding of key process constraints such as membrane channel clogging, and of the science of membrane cleaning. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper reviews the problems and successes of computing turbulent flow. Most of the flow phenomena that are important to modern technology involve turbulence. The review is concerned with methods for turbulent flow computer predictions and their applications, and describes several of them. These computational methods are aimed at simulating either as much detail of the turbulent motion as possible by current computer power or, more commonly, its overall effect on the mean-flow behaviour. The methods are still being developed and some of the most recent concepts involved are discussed. Some success has been achieved with two-equation models for relatively simple hydrodynamic phenomena; indeed, routine design work has been undertaken during the last three decades in several applications of engineering practice, for which extensive studies have optimized these models. Failures are still common for many applications particularly those that involve strong curvature, intermittency, strong buoyancy influences, low-Reynolds-number effects, rapid compression or expansion, strong swirl, and kinetically-influenced chemical reaction. New conceptual developments are needed in these areas, probably along the lines of actually calculating the principal manifestation of turbulence, e.g. intermittency. A start has been made in this direction in the form of ‘multi-fluid' models, and full simulations. The turbulence modelling approaches presented here are, Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS), Two-Fluid models, Very Large Eddy Simulation (VLES), Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS), Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) and some interesting, relatively recent, hybrid LES/RANS techniques. A large number of relatively recent studies are considered, together with reference to the numerical experiments existing on the subject. The authors hope that they provide the interested reader with most of the appropriate sources of turbulence modelling, exhibiting either as much detail as it is possible, by means of bibliography, or illustrating some of the most recent developments on the numerical modelling of turbulent flows. Thus, the potential user has the appropriate information, for him to select the suitable turbulence model for his own case of interest.},

@article{Kang2004,
abstract = {A laboratory-scale membrane filtration cell was constructed to enable direct microscopic observation of microbial cell deposition and release in cross-flow microfiltration. Initial deposition rates determined from microscopic images were interpreted through an interaction force model. Experimentally derived deposition rates and model calculations confirmed that initial cell and particle deposition was governed by permeation drag and electrostatic double layer forces. Microbial deposition rates increased linearly with increasing permeation velocity over several orders of magnitude, but decreased dramatically with small increases to membrane and particle zeta potential. Cross-flow velocity had no effect on initial deposition up to cross-flow Reynolds numbers of 600. Cell deposition rates were significantly lower at high ionic strength and low pH due to cell aggregation in the bulk. Model equations suggested that cell aggregates were more strongly influenced by tangential shear and lift forces, which tend to reduce deposition. The interaction force model predicted at a set of "critical operating conditions" at which cells were reversibly deposited. Direct observation experiments verified that most cells deposited under the predicted "critical" conditions were easily removed when permeation ceased - without the need for back-pulsing or chemical cleaning. Beyond the fundamental knowledge gained from this study, the experimental and theoretical techniques presented may prove valuable in identifying particle and biological fouling potentials of new membrane materials, as well as in developing effective fouling control strategies for environmental membrane separations. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In recent years optical non-destructive methods for 3D surface metrology have become increasingly important in contrast to traditional tactile measurement techniques. Here, we present the operating principle and possible applications of the optical 3D measurement system " InfiniteFocus " , which is based on the technology of Focus-Variation and used for quality assurance in the lab and in production. In contrast to traditional tactile methods it is able to perform 3D measurements without touching the surface, it measures whole areas instead of only surface profiles and delivers true color information in addition to the 3D data. The technique of Focus-Variation combines the small depth of focus of an optical system with vertical scanning to provide topographical and color information from the variation of focus. The main characteristics of the system are that it delivers high resolution measurements of even complex surfaces, that it is able to measure surfaces with steep flanks up to 80°, with strongly varying reflection properties and greatly varying roughness. In addition to 3D and color information a repeatability measure is analytically estimated for each measurement point. Focus-Variation is used to perform high resolution 3D surface measurement for industrial quality assurance as well as research and development activities. Key applications are surface measurement and characterization in e.g. cutting tool industry, precision manufacturing, automotive industry, all kinds of materials science, corrosion and tribology, electronics, medical device development or paper industry. We demonstrate the capabilities of the system on a series of applications including wear analysis of cutting tools, the inspection of welding spots and different applications in the field of engineering and material science.},

abstract = {We have investigated, theoretically, the physical properties of cake layers formed from aggregates to obtain a better understanding of membrane systems used in conjunction with coagulation/flocculation pretreatment. We developed a model based on fractal theory and incorporated a cake collapse effect to predict the porosity and permeability of the cake layers. The floc size, fractal dimension, and transmembrane pressure were main parameters that we used in these model calculations. We performed experiments using a batch cell device and a confocal laser-scanning microscope to verify the predicted specific cake resistances and porosities under various conditions. Based on the results of the model, the reduction in inter-aggregate porosity is more important than that in intra-aggregate porosity during the cake collapsing process. The specific cake resistance decreases upon increasing the aggregate size and decreasing the fractal dimensions. The modeled porosities and specific cake resistances of the collapsed cake layer agreed reasonably well with those obtained experimentally.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {In a membrane bioreactor (MBR), the tangential flow along the membrane creates significant shear stresses. The purpose of this research consists in underlining the role of these shear stresses in the granulometric distribution of a biological suspension and in the mechanisms of membrane fouling. The role of the different classes of organic particles (settleable, supracolloidal-colloidal, soluble) in membrane fouling is quantified. The laboratory-scale reactor consists of an MBR composed of a pressurizing fermenter associated with a microfiltration module. The activated sludge is recirculated inside the MBR. During this recirculation under different linear velocities, several samples of the suspension are taken off and granulometric analyses and dead-end filtration tests are carried out. The results show that the recirculation induces a modification of the granulometric distribution of the particle size. This change, related to the destructuring of the floc and to the high amount of microflocs, is characterized by a decrease in the settleable fraction and, consequently, by an increase in the non-settleable fraction. Dead-end filtrations of different types of suspension (flocculated and recirculated) show that the shear stresses imposed on the suspension can modify its filterability. Hydraulic resistances obtained for recirculated suspensions are greater than those obtained for flocculated suspensions. Next, the role in the membrane fouling of the three main families of particles (settleable, supracolloidal-colloidal and soluble) is quantified by cross-flow filtrations during MBR operations. The results reveal the significant role of the soluble fraction on membrane permeability: in our operating conditions, half of the total resistance could be due to the soluble compounds. It seems that these different soluble products and their interaction with the membrane material play a major role in the fouling mechanism.},

abstract = {Under laminar flow conditions, when no external forces are applied, particles are generally thought to follow fluid streamlines. Contrary to this perspective, we observe that flowing particles migrate across streamlines in a continuous, predictable, and accurate manner in microchannels experiencing laminar flows. The migration is attributed to lift forces on particles that are observed when inertial aspects of the flow become significant. We identified symmetric and asymmetric channel geometries that provide additional inertial forces that bias particular equilibrium positions to create continuous streams of ordered particles precisely positioned in three spatial dimensions. We were able to order particles laterally, within the transverse plane of the channel, with {\textgreater}80-nm accuracy, and longitudinally, in regular chains along the direction of flow. A fourth dimension of rotational alignment was observed for discoidal red blood cells. Unexpectedly, ordering appears to be independent of particle buoyant direction, suggesting only minor centrifugal contributions. Theoretical analysis indicates the physical principles are operational over a range of channel and particle length scales. The ability to differentially order particles of different sizes, continuously, at high rates, and without external forces in microchannels is expected to have a broad range of applications in continuous bioparticle separation, high-throughput cytometry, and large-scale filtration systems.},

The gray-box modeling technique is very valuable whenever a knowledge-based model exists, but is not fully satisfactory and cannot be improved by further analysis (or can only be improved at a very large computational cost). We describe the design methodology of a gray-box model, and illustrate it on a didactic example. We emphasize the importance of the choice of the discretization scheme used for transforming the differential equations of the knowledge-based model into a set of discrete-time recurrent equations.

abstract = {The performance of industrial membrane processes is affected by the time dependence of permeate flux, which includes both the absolute value and the rate of decrease in permeate flux at a given time. In particular, long-term fouling will affect the performance of industrial membrane processes that operate continuously for long periods of time, such as industrial whey ultrafiltration processes that can operate for up to 14 h every day. Results of whey ultrafiltration experiments conducted on a pilot scale membrane rig were used to establish a unified model for the time dependence of permeate flux during long-term ultrafiltration. Experimental results indicate that the effects of trans-membrane pressure and feed concentration on the rate of decrease in the permeate flux due to long-term fouling are statistically insignificant. The unified model from this paper can be applied in conjunction with the process dynamics models to study the performance of automatic controllers prior to controller design. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The composition of the microbial community present in the nitrifying-denitrifying activated sludge of an industrial wastewater treatment plant connected to a rendering facility was investigated by the full-cycle rRNA approach. After DNA extraction using three different methods, 94 almost full-length 16S rRNA gene clones were retrieved and analyzed phylogenetically. 59{\%} of the clones were affiliated with the Proteobacteria and clustered with the beta- (29 clones), alpha- (24), and delta-class (2 clones), respectively. 15 clones grouped within the green nonsulfur (GNS) bacteria and 11 clones belonged to the Planctomycetes. The Verrucomicrobia, Acidobacteria, Nitrospira, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria were each represented by one to five clones. Interestingly, the highest 'species richness' [measured as number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs)] was found within the alpha-class of Proteobacteria, followed by the Planctomycetes, the beta-class of Proteobacteria, and the GNS-bacteria. The microbial community composition of the activated sludge was determined quantitatively by using 36 group-, subgroup-, and OTU-specific rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), confocal laser scanning microscopy and digital image analysis. 89{\%} of all bacteria detectable by FISH with a bacterial probe set could be assigned to specific divisions. Consistent with the 16S rRNA gene library data, members of the beta-class of Proteobacteria dominated the microbial community and represented almost half of the biovolume of all bacteria detectable by FISH. Within the beta-class, 98{\%} of the cells could be identified by the application of genus- or OTU-specific probes demonstrating a high in situ abundance of bacteria related to Zoogloea and Azoarcus sensu lato. Taken together, this study provides the first encompassing, high-resolution insight into the in situ composition of the microbial community present in a full-scale, industrial wastewater treatment plant.},

abstract = {The energy vs distance balance of cell suspensions (in the presence and in the absence of extracellular biopolymer solutions) is studied, not only in the light of the classical Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Over-beek (DLVO) theory (which considered just the electrostatic (EL) and Lifshitz-van der Waals (LW) interactions), but also by taking electron-acceptor/electron-donor, or Lewis acid-base (AB) and osmotic (OS) interactions into account. Since cell surfaces, as well as many biopolymers tend to have strong monopolar electron-donor properties, they are able to engage in a strong mutual AB repulsion when immersed in a polar liquid such as water. The effects of that repulsion have been observed earlier in the guise of hydration pressure. The AB repulsion is, at close range, typically one or two orders of magnitude stronger than the EL repulsion, but its rate of decay is much steeper. In most cases, AB interactions are quantitatively the dominant factor in cell stability (when repulsive) and in ``hydrophobic interactions'' (when attractive). OS interactions exerted by extracellularly dissolved biopolymers are weak, but their rate of decay is very gradual, so OS repulsions engendered by biopolymer solutions may be of importance in certain long-range interactions. OS interactions exerted by biopolymers attached to cells or particles (e.g., by glycocalix glycoproteins), are very short-ranged and usually are negligibly small in comparison with the other interaction forces, in aqueous media.},

abstract = {Biodiesel was produced from canola oil and methanol in a novel membrane reactor. The membrane in the reactor served to separate the unreacted emulsified oil from the product stream, producing high-purity fatty acid methyl ester (FAME). The effects of the pore size of the membrane used in the semicontinuous reactor and the initial methanol/canola oil loading were studied. Four carbon membranes having different pore sizes of 0.05, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.4 $\mu$m were tested, with four different initial methanol volume fractions ($\phi$1) of 0.29, 0.38, 0.47, and 0.64. It was found that all four membranes retained canola oil in the reactor. Permeate was observed at the 0.38, 0.47, and 0.64 initial methanol volume fractions, whereas it was not observed at $\phi$1= 0.29. The initial oil loadings represent methanol/oil mole ratios of 11:1, 16:1, 23:1, and 46:1. For all runs, no triglycerides were found in the permeate. The permeate dephased upon cooling to room temperature. Glycerol was not detected in the FAME-rich phase. This opens the possibility of reaching methanol/oil mole ratios of 6:1 with a single recycling step.},

abstract = {Surface roughness (texture) has an effect on fluid flow in networks which has been studied for well over a century. The exact effect roughness has on fluid flow has not been completely understood, but a working estimate has been offered by a variety of authors over time. The work of Colebrook, Nikuradse, and Moody has provided practitioners with a method to include at least a first order estimate of roughness effects, but their work has been limited to relative roughness (roughness height to diameter) values of 5{\%} or less. Modern fluidic systems at the mini- and micro-levels routinely violate the 5{\%} relative roughness threshold due to the inability to control the roughness of surfaces to sufficient levels with respect to decreasing system scale. Current work by Kandlikar et al., has extended the traditional methods of assessing surface roughness effects up to 14{\%} relative roughness by including the effect of constricted flow diameters (modified flow diameter based on constrictions caused by surface roughness) and modifying the Moody diagram to reflect new experimental data. The future of micro fluidics would suggest that trends for miniaturization will continue and that further understanding and experimentation will be warranted. This is especially true with regards to understanding the role of roughness on the flow in mini- and micro-channels.},

The feed stream in the tube, which flows mainly tangentially to the porous wall, is modelled by the Navier-Stokes equations. A method of coupling the Navier-Stokes and the Darcy equations in a solution scheme was considered to develop a fluid dynamic model of crossflow filtration. The governing equations were solved numerically using a finite difference scheme. The solution depends on both the Reynolds axial and filtration number.

abstract = {In cross-flow ultrafiltration permeate flux has three types of flow regimes. Initially it has a transient regime with a decreasing permeate flow rate. Then it attains a steady state, and the flux reaches a plateau. In the third stage the flow rate becomes independent of applied pressure and is called the limiting flux. In this paper a general membrane fouling modeling was developed that accounts for internal clogging, partial and total clogging, cake deposition and cake deposition with retroflux for any type of filtration; and it is validated with the experimental data of cross-flow ultrafiltration of suspensions containing suspended solids and oil droplets. A relationship for the limiting flux was developed using the experimental data. The fouling was then quantified and linked to the operational parameters. The main operating parameter affecting the filtration process was temperature. Indeed, this determined the droplet and particle size distribution, which is found highly dispersed at any temperature leading to standard deviations of the same order of magnitudes as or even larger than the mean diameters. The major limiting processes that controlled the fouling were evidenced and explained by mean droplet size and size distribution. A systematic study of the influence of the different operational parameters on the transient filtration rate is presented for different temperatures. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Laboratory experiments on the activated sludge (AS) process were carried out to investigate the influence of microbial extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), including loosely bound EPS (LB-EPS) and tightly bound EPS (TB-EPS), on biomass flocculation, sludge settlement and dewaterability. The heat EPS extraction method was modified to include a mild step and a harsh step for extracting the LB-EPS and TB-EPS, respectively, from the sludge suspension. Six lab-scale AS reactors were used to grow AS with different carbon sources of glucose and sodium acetate, and different sludge retention times (SRTs) of 5, 10 and 20 days. The variation in the bioreactor condition produced sludge with different abundances of EPS and different flocculation and separation characteristics. The sludge that was fed on glucose had more EPS than the sludge that was fed on acetate. For any of the feeding substrates, the sludge had a nearly consistent TB-EPS value regardless of the SRT, and an LB-EPS content that decreased with the SRT. The acetate-fed sludge performed better than the glucose-fed sludge in terms of bioflocculation, sludge sedimentation and compression, and sludge dewaterability. The sludge flocculation and separation improved considerably as the SRT lengthened. The results demonstrate that the LB-EPS had a negative effect on bioflocculation and sludge-water separation. The parameters for the performance of sludge-water separation were much more closely correlated with the amount of LB-EPS than with the amount of TB-EPS. It is argued that although EPS is essential to sludge floc formation, excessive EPS in the form of LB-EPS could weaken cell attachment and the floc structure, resulting in poor bioflocculation, greater cell erosion and retarded sludge-water separation. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The use of particles as foam and emulsion stabilising species, with or without surfactants, has received great interest in recent years. The majority of work has studied the effects of particles as stabilisers in emulsion systems, but recent successes has widened consideration into foams, where industries such as flotation and food processing have encountered the effects of particle stabilisation for many years. This review seeks to clarify studies into emulsions, highlighting new research in this area, and relate similarities and differences to foam systems. Past research has focused on defining the interaction mechanisms of stability, such as principles of attachment energies, particle-particle forces at the interface and changes to the interfilm, with a view to ascertain conditions giving optimum stability. Studied conditions include effects of particle contact angle, aggregation formations, concentration, size and interactions of other species (i.e. surfactant). Mechanisms can be complex, but overall the principle of particles creating a steric barrier to coalescence, is a straitforward basis of interaction. Much research in emulsions can be applied to foam systems, however evidence would suggest foam systems are under a number of additional constraints, and the stability 'window' for particles is smaller, in terms of size and contact angle ranges. Also, because of increased density differences and interfilm perturbations in foam systems, retardation of drainage is often as important to stability as inhibiting coalescence. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

abstract = {We perform direct numerical simulations of a rigid sphere translating parallel to a flat wall in an otherwise quiescent ambient fluid. A spectral element method is employed to perform the simulations with high accuracy. For Re 100, we observe the lift coefficient to decrease with both Reynolds number and distance from the wall. In this regime the present results are in good agreement with the low-Reynolds-number theory of Vasseur Cox (1977), with the recent experiments of Takemura Magnaudet (2003) and with the simulations of Kim et al. (1993). The most surprising result from the present simulations is that the wall-induced lift coefficient increases dramatically with increasing Re above about 100. Detailed analysis of the flow field around the sphere suggests that this increase is due to an imperfect bifurcation resulting in the formation of a double-threaded wake vortical structure. In addition to a non-rotating sphere, we also simulate a freely rotating sphere in order to assess the importance of free rotation on the translational motion of the sphere. We observe the effect of sphere rotation on lift and drag forces to be small. We also explore the effect of the wall on the onset of unsteadiness},

The word separation classically conjures up a model of removing one component or species from a second component, for example a mass transfer process such as distillation. In the field of synthetic membranes, the terminology 'separation' is used in a wider context. A range of separations of the chemical/mass transfer type have developed around the use of membranes including distillation, extraction, absorption, adsorption},

Thus, chemical cleaning of the membranes is essential. In this paper, results obtained from investigations on a polysulfon ultrafiltration membrane fouled by precipitation of milk components have been presented. In this research the effect of different cleaning agents on the recovery of the fouled membrane has been studied. Results show that a combination of sodium dodecyl sulfate and sodium hydroxide can be used as a cleaning material to reach the optimum recovery of the polysulfon membranes used in milk concentration industries. Also a mixture of sodium hypocholorite and sodium hydroxide shows acceptable results, where washing with acidic material has no considerable performance.},

abstract = {Previous studies of protein fouling during microfiltration have shown significant discrepancies between filtrate flux data and predictions of the classical pore blockage, pore constriction, and cake filtration models. A new mathematical model was developed for the filtrate flux which accounts for initial fouling due to pore blockage and subsequent fouling due to the growth of a protein cake or deposit over these initially blocked regions. The model explicitly accounts for the inhomogeneity in the cake layer thickness over different regions of the membrane arising from the time-dependent blockage of the pore surface. The model was shown to be in excellent agreement with experimental data obtained during the stirred cell filtration of bovine serum albumin solutions through polycarbonate track-etched microfiltration membranes over the entire course of the filtration. The model provides a smooth transition from the pore blockage to cake filtration regimes, eliminating the need to use different mathematical formulations to describe these two phenomena. In addition, the model provides the first quantitative explanation for some of the unusual observations reported previously in investigations of protein microfiltration. The results provide important insights into the underlying mechanisms of protein fouling during microfiltration. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

This summer school took place in Neptun-Olimp, Romania, in the period of July 21 25, 2003. The purpose of this report is to give students that are already familiar with the physics and numerical computation of single phase flow a compact introduction into the computational modeling of multiphase flows. The report is restricted to the hydrodynamics of multiphase flow and does not consider heat transfer, mass transfer and phase change. The report gives first an insight in the fundamental hydrodynamical phenomena of multiphase flows. It then presents the most popular modeling concepts for multiphase flows and points out their achievements and limitations. It details the continuous or interpenetrating field formulation of two-phase flow based on a volume averaging procedure and presents the related models as there are the homogeneous model, the diffusion model and drift flux model, and the two-fluid model. The report also discusses the Euler-Lagrange approach for disperse flow as well as interface resolving simulation methods such as the volume-of-fluid method, the level-set method and the front-tracking method.},

abstract = {Microfiltration (MF) is a frequently used to clarify wine, but the fouling of the membranes is the main limiting factor for the overall process capacity. In this work, data from MF clarification of a white wine are presented which show that membranes made from polypropylene (PP) yield significantly higher fluxes and through-put than membranes made from polyarylsulfone, both having the same cut-off pore size (0.2 $\mu$m). The aim of this study was then to pursue the hypothesis that different membranes (based on PP or polyethersulfone, PES) exhibit different levels of adsorption of typical foulants in wine such as polyphenols and polysaccharides, to link the level of adsorption to polymer characteristics and to correlate membrane fluxes with these findings. A model solution for wine ("synthetic red wine") has been established by using a commercial red grape marc extract (from grapes after fermentation). It was found that polyphenols and polysaccharides are only marginally adsorbed by PP but strongly adsorbed by PES membranes. Comparison between data for individual model substances for polyphenol or polysaccharide and their mixtures with data for "synthetic red wine" support the hypothesis that aggregates of polyphenols and polysaccharides present in red wine have a strong contribution to adsorptive fouling, and that the interaction between polyphenols and the membrane surface is the main driving force. In consequence, the low adsorption tendency of wine ingredients to PP membranes results in higher fluxes and longer service life of the respective filtration modules in wine clarification. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

@article{Li2006,
abstract = {A mathematical model was developed to model membrane fouling in a submerged membrane bioreactor (SMBR) used for wastewater treatment and reclamation. The sectional technique was employed to account for the uneven distribution of the aeration turbulent shear intensity and the fouling material coverage on the membrane surface. The dynamics of the biomass attachment to and detachment from the membrane in relation to the filtration and aeration turbulence were considered in the model formation. The fouling components of pore clogging, sludge cake growth, and temporal sludge film coverage were included in the calculation of the total membrane fouling resistance. With this new model, membrane fouling under different SMBR operational conditions can be successfully simulated, and the influences of a number of process variables on fouling development can be well quantified. The simulation results demonstrate that filtration flux is the most significant factor that causes sludge cake deposition and fouling problems, followed by sludge stickiness and sludge concentration, and that aeration is important for fouling control. Membrane fouling due to sludge cake accumulation can be minimized in an SMBR by using a lower sludge concentration, enhancing the aeration rate, and reducing the filtration flux. The results of the numerical simulations compare fairly well with the experimental results that were obtained with a laboratory-scale SMBR in this study, which validates the applicability of the new fouling model. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The focus of this study was to empirically estimate the specific cake resistance (SCR) by the variation in shear intensity (G) in four laboratory-scale MBRs. The control reactor (MBR0) was operated with aeration only while other MBRs (MBR150, MBR300 and MBR450) were operated with aeration and mechanical mixing intensities of 150, 300 and 450 rpm, respectively. It was found that the SCR was strongly correlated (R2 = 0.99) with the fouling rates in the MBRs. Moreover, the contribution of cake resistance (Rc) to the total hydraulic resistance (Rt) was predominant compared to the irreversible fouling resistance (Rf). On this basis, the cake filtration model was selected as a predictive tool for membrane fouling. This model was modified by replacing the SCR with its empirical shear intensity relationship. The modified model can predict the fouling rate for a given shear intensity (G) within 80 and 250 s-1 in a MBR system. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Clinical point of care testing often needs plasma instead of whole blood. As centrifugation is labor intensive and not always accessible, filtration is a more appropriate separation technique. The complexity of whole blood is such that there is still no commercially available filtration system capable of separating small sample volumes (10-100 $\mu$l) at the point of care. The microfluidics research in blood filtration is very active but to date nobody has validated a low cost device that simultaneously filtrates small samples of whole blood and reproducibly recovers clinically relevant biomarkers, and all this in a limited amount of time with undiluted raw samples. In this paper, we show first that plasma filtration from undiluted whole blood is feasible and reproducible in a low-cost microfluidic device. This novel microfluidic blood filtration element (BFE) extracts 12 $\mu$l of plasma from 100 $\mu$l of whole blood in less than 10 min. Then, we demonstrate that our device is valid for clinical studies by measuring the adsorption of interleukins through our system. This adsorption is reproducible for interleukins IL6, IL8, and IL10 but not for TNF$\alpha$. Hence, our BFE is valid for clinical diagnostics with simple calibration prior to performing any measurement.},

@article{Griffiths2014,
abstract = {Membrane fouling during particle filtration occurs through a variety of mechanisms, including internal pore clogging by contaminants, coverage of pore entrances, and deposition on the membrane surface. Each of these fouling mechanisms results in a decline in the observed flow rate over time, and the decrease in filtration efficiency can be characterized by a unique signature formed by plotting the volumetric flux, Q{\^{}}, as a function of the total volume of fluid processed, V{\^{}}. When membrane fouling takes place via any one of these mechanisms independently the Q{\^{}}V{\^{}} signature is always convex downwards for filtration under a constant transmembrane pressure. However, in many such filtration scenarios, the fouling mechanisms are inherently coupled and the resulting signature is more difficult to interpret. For instance, blocking of a pore entrance will be exacerbated by the internal clogging of a pore, while the deposition of a layer of contaminants is more likely once the pores have been covered by particulates. As a result, the experimentally observed Q{\^{}}V{\^{}} signature can vary dramatically from the canonical convex-downwards graph, revealing features that are not captured by existing continuum models. In a range of industrially relevant cases we observe a concave-downwardsQ{\^{}}V{\^{}} signature, indicative of a fouling rate that becomes more severe with time. We derive a network model for membrane fouling that accounts for the inter-relation between fouling mechanisms and demonstrate the impact on the Q{\^{}}V{\^{}} signature. Our formulation recovers the behaviour of existing models when the mechanisms are treated independently, but also elucidates the concave-downward Q{\^{}}V{\^{}} signature for multiple interactive fouling mechanisms. The resulting model enables post-experiment analysis to identify the dominant fouling modality at each stage, and is able to provide insight into selecting appropriate operating regimes.},

abstract = {Soluble microbial products (SMP) in the sludge water phase are regarded as the main foulant in MBRs. This study further developed an existing hydrodynamic model by incorporating energy consumption. The focus was on the cost-effectiveness of crossflow (CF) velocity in the control of submicron particle deposition. A sensitivity analysis showed that CF had the greatest impact on both particle backtransport and energy consumption. The other operational variables, i.e., dry solid content (DS), membrane tube dimension (D and L) and temperature (T) were generally less influential with respect to particle backtransport and energy consumption. Submicron particles were likely to deposit in side-stream MBRs, and the lowest backtransport velocity was found for particle radii around 0.1 $\mu$m and CF below 0.5 m/s. A particle size distribution (PSD) profile of MBR sludge showed a main peak at 40 $\mu$m and a second peak at 0.1-1 $\mu$m. The abundance of submicron particles at 2000 kDa was confirmed by a Liquid chromatography-Organic Carbon Detection (LC-OCD) analysis. The colloids responsible for the second peak in the PSD received high weighting factors (high filter cake formation potential) in the model optimization. In a lab-scale MBR, this critical crossflow velocity was between 0.75 and 1 m/s at 40 L/(m2 h). {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Membrane processes are gaining importance for water treatment applications as a result of the advances in membrane technology and increasing requirements on water quality. Membrane fouling, which results in loss of productivity, is one of the most important operational concerns of membrane processes. A number of theoretical models have been developed to explain membrane fouling mechanisms. These models use the system parameters (i.e., viscosity, pore size, membrane thickness, pressure) and unsteady-state material and flow balance equations with specific boundary conditions. As a result, they are of scientific interest and have limited use for practical applications. The purpose of the study was to develop a simple flux model to estimate the characteristic fouling times for ultrafiltration systems based on operational data. A simple first-order model was developed based on the resistances-in-series approach to correlate flux to a characteristic clean membrane parameter, system parameters. The model was used to estimate the characteristic fouling times of a laboratory ultrafiltration system.},

abstract = {To remove the fouling layer and thus to maintain an economically feasible net permeability, air scour of the membrane by coarse bubbling and backflushing from the permeate side (hollow-fibre modules) or relaxation (flat sheet modules) are currently employed. These measures are neither optimised nor controlled, i.e., they are often carried out before they are necessary, thereby wasting energy, permeate or chemicals, or too late. This leads to losses in productivity and to environmental hazards through the formation of chemical cleaning by-products such as AOX. Mechanistic models which describe filtration and fouling mechanisms exist, but have not yet been used for process control. The aim of this work is to develop model-based control strategies for membrane operation which reduce energetic expenditure and increase filtration efficiency. A novel model-based control strategy for membrane operation is presented which is based on an automated recognition of the currently dominant filtration mechanism. Thus, suitable control actions can be carried out in order to increase the permeability respective to each mechanism improving the filtration performance in membrane bioreactors (MBR). The validation of the model recognition approach is demonstrated using experimental data from a test cell as well as from an MBR pilot plant. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In the crossflow microfiltration of particles, a deposit cake layer tends to form on the membrane and this usually controls the performance of the filtration process. This paper presents observations of particle deposition on membrane surfaces using a non-invasive, in situ, continuous direct observation through the membrane (DOTM) technique. The particles used in the experiments were typical of microfiltration processes, yeast (mean diameter 5$\mu$m) and latex beads (3, 6.4 and 12$\mu$m). The filtration tests were conducted in the imposed flux mode, so that the flux could be controlled at, below, or above the “critical flux”. Below the critical flux, the particle deposition was negligible; near the critical flux the particle deposition was significant; and above the critical flux, particle layers were formed on the membrane surface. Rolling of the particles was observed during the filtration of 6.4$\mu$m latex near the critical flux whereas a flowing cake layer was observed during the filtration of 3$\mu$m latex. The particle size distribution of the deposited particles changed with the crossflow velocity, with smaller particles deposited on the membrane at higher crossflow velocity. Comparison of the normalised flux (J/$\Delta$P) with the membrane area coverage by the particles revealed that for filtration of latex particles “flux percentage (with respect to the clean membrane)” was marginally greater than the percentage of uncovered membrane area, whereas for filtration of yeast, the “flux percentage” was significantly less than the uncovered area percentage due to the deposition of smaller cell debris species. This paper demonstrates that DOTM is a powerful technique for the study of fundamentals of particle deposition and interactions between the particles and the membrane.},

abstract = {Cake layer formation on the membrane surface has been a major challenge in the operation of membrane bioreactors (MBRs). In this study, the cake layer formation mechanism in an MBR used for synthetic wastewater treatment was investigated. The major components of cake layer were systematically examined by particle size analyzer (PSA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), energy-diffusive X-ray analyzer (EDX), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The results indicate that the small particles in sludge suspension had a strong deposit tendency on the membrane surface. The SEM and CLSM analysis exhibited that bacterial clusters and polysaccharides were significant contributors to membrane fouling. The main components of biopolymers were identified as proteins and polysaccharide materials by the FTIR. The examination by EDX and XRF demonstrated that Mg, Al, Ca, Si, and Fe were the major inorganic elements in fouling cake. Furthermore, the results suggest that bridging between deposited biopolymers and inorganic compounds could enhance the compactness of fouling layer. During the operation of MBRs, the biopolymers and inorganic elements in the bioreactor should be controlled to minimize membrane fouling.},

abstract = {This study focused on the physicochemical and biological characteristics of sludge in submerged membrane bioreactors (MBRs) at various sludge retention times (SRT) and their effect on microfiltration and membrane fouling. Three lab-scale submerged MBRs at SRT of 20, 40, and 60 days were performed at a constant permeate flux of 9l/(m2h) with hollow fiber microfiltration membranes (hydrophilized polypropylene; nominal pore size=0.4??m). In order to evaluate the relative contribution of microbial floc and supernatant to the membrane fouling, supernatant was separated from the sludge by centrifugation at 366rad/s for 5min. Batch filtration experiments with the same configuration showed that the relative contribution of supernatant to overall membrane fouling was higher at SRT of 20 days (37{\%}) than at SRT of 40 (28{\%}) and 60 days (29{\%}), whereas the overall fouling resistance increased as SRT prolonged. Hydrophobicity (correlation coefficient, r=0.86; significant value, P{\textless}0.05), surface charge (r=0.87, P{\textless}0.05) and microbial activity (r=-0.87, P{\textless}0.05), which were related to composition and properties of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), appeared key parameters relating to fouling by microbial floc.

abstract = {Membrane filtration in municipal and industrial wastewater treatment is a technology being increasingly employed to enhance the quality of purified water, increase the productivity of existing plants, and build smaller, yet more effective purification processes. Barrier to a breakthrough of the technology is the increased operational cost due to fouling and membrane replacement. Simulation studies with rigorous process models are a powerful tool to increase the understanding of the process and its decisive characteristics in order to design optimal processes and efficient operational strategies. In this paper, two enhancements of existing modeling approaches are proposed. One is taking into account the adhesive forces between the particles and the membrane surface, which indeed strongly effect cake layer formation and back flushing efficiency. The other is assessing the decisive influence of particle and membrane pore size distributions on both cake layer formation and pore blocking and their mutual dependencies. Both phenomena are essential characteristics which need to be considered for a reliable prediction of process behavior. The model is successfully tested in simulation studies and compared to experimental data from a pilot wastewater treatment plant with submerged hollow fiber membranes. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper reports an experimental and numerical study conducted to investigate the behavior of macroscopic monomodal concentrated suspensions (40{\%}) undergoing a creeping torsional flow between two rotating plates. An experimental technique based on the detection of tracers by measurement of light absorption is developed and used to quantify the time evolution of 1:he particles concentration profiles. Contrarily to results reported in the literature, an outward migration of the particles is observed. This shear-induced migration is confirmed by viscometric measurements where an increase in the apparent viscosity of the suspension has been observed for long periods of shear. Moreover, this increase is found to depend solely on the value of the applied strain, which is consistent with a shear-induced migration phenomenon. Experimental results are reproduced using a semi-quantitative model involving the balance of three diffusion fluxes induced, respectively, by the gradient of viscosity (J(eta)), the gradient of the collision rate between particles (J(c)), and the flow curvature (J(r)). Steady and transient numerical profiles are obtained using a finite volume approach. The coefficients of the diffusion fluxes (K,,K,,K,) are determined by optimizing the numerical profiles to fit the experimental data. The ratios of these coefficients (K-eta/K-C and K-r/K-C) are found to be independent of the flow geometry with their absolute values being tightly coupled to the direction of particles drift. In particular, the migration coefficients, in the direction of the velocity gradient (in a cylindrical Couette flow) are found to be almost five times larger than those along the direction of vorticity (in a rotating parallel-plate flow).

The terms include the key vocabulary used in the literature concerned with scientific, technical and commercial aspects of the membrane field. Processes and membranes based on synthetic or modified natural polymers as well as ceramic and metallic membranes are covered. The resultant terms and their definitions represent a core set that: will allow uniform understanding and eliminate most ambiguity or confusion caused by conflicting terminology now in use. The terms and definitions selected for inclusion reflect the majority preference of the membrane community. To avoid irreconcilable differences, definitions and descriptions involving interpretations of phenomena were minimized. Some terms were deleted in cases where majority preferences were not apparent. This strategy was adopted with the understanding that the current core group of terms, which enjoy majority support, can be augmented as evolution of the field occurs.},

abstract = {The densest amorphous packing of rigid particles is known as random close packing. It has long been appreciated that higher densities are achieved by using collections of particles with a variety of sizes. The variety of sizes is often quantified by the polydispersity of the particle size distribution: the standard deviation of the radius divided by the mean radius. Several prior studies quantified the increase of the packing density as a function of polydispersity. Of course, a particle size distribution is also characterized by its skewness, kurtosis, and higher moments, but the influence of these parameters has not been carefully quantified before. In this work, we numerically generate many packings with different particle radii distributions, varying polydispersity and skewness independently of one another. We find two significant results. First, the skewness can have a significant effect on the packing density and in some cases can have a larger effect than polydispersity. Second, the packing fraction is relatively insensitive to the value of the kurtosis. We present a simple empirical formula for the value of the random close packing density as a function of polydispersity and skewness.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the industrial applications of porous ceramics membranes. Pressure-driven membrane processes are among the most mature membrane technologies. They are used for liquid separations and are generally classified into four categories: reverse osmosis (RO), nanofiltration (NF), ultrafiltration (UF), andmicrofiltration (MF). Pressure-driven membrane processes at present have high industrial impact, with a market constantly growing. They are used in a wide range of separation processes and are considered among the best available technologies (BAT), in the European Union environmental recommendations because they present several advantages with respect to other separation processes. The main applications of RO are found in the desalination of brackish and seawater; the production of ultrapure water (electronic industry); concentration of food juice, sugars, and milk; and in the treatment of wastewater. The performance of the ceramic membrane-based systems depends on the separation and permeation properties of the membrane as well as its mechanical integrity. These properties depend on the selective top layer and on the support system on which the active separation layer is coated. Therefore, pore size, porosity, surface roughness, and mechanical properties—all are important parameters.},

abstract = {Adequate membrane bioreactor operation requires frequent evaluation of the membrane state. A data-driven approach based on principal component analysis (PCA) and fuzzy clustering extracting the necessary monitoring information solely out of transmembrane pressure data was investigated for this purpose. Out of three tested PCA techniques the two functional methods proved useful to cope with noise and outliers as opposed to the common standard PCA, while all of them presented similar capabilities for revealing data trends and patterns. The expert functional PCA approach enabled linking the two major trends in the data to reversible fouling and irreversible fouling. The B-splines approach provided a more objective way for functional representation of the data set but its complexity did not appear justified by better results. The fuzzy clustering algorithm, applied after PCA, was successful in recognizing the data trends and placing the cluster centres in meaningful positions, as such supporting data analysis. However, the algorithm did not allow a correct classification of all data. Factor analysis was used instead, exploiting the linearity of the observed two dimensional trends, to completely split the reversible and irreversible fouling effects and classify the data in a more pragmatic approach. Overall, the tested techniques appeared useful and can serve as the basis for automatic membrane fouling monitoring and control. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

For predicting numeric quantities, there has been work on combining these two schemes into ‘model trees', i.e. trees that contain linear regression functions at the leaves. In this paper, we present an algorithm that adapts this idea for classification problems, using logistic regression instead of linear regression. We use a stagewise fitting process to construct the logistic regression models that can select relevant attributes in the data in a natural way, and show how this approach can be used to build the logistic regression models at the leaves by incrementally refining those constructed at higher levels in the tree. We compare the performance of our algorithm to several other state-of-the-art learning schemes on 36 benchmark UCI datasets, and show that it produces accurate and compact classifiers},

abstract = {This paper examines the influence of activated sludge properties such as the mixed liquid of suspended solids (MLSS) concentration, sludge particle size distribution (PSD), extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), soluble microbial products (SMP), suspended solids in supernatant (SSs), dynamic viscosity ($\mu$), relative hydrophobicity (RH), and zeta potential on membrane fouling. Activated sludge samples from different full-scale and lab-scale membrane bioreactor processes were used to study their impacts on membrane fouling. The influence of activated sludge properties on membrane permeation was identified with statistical methods. The results showed that MLSS concentration had an exponential relationship with membrane fouling resistance. The sludge particle size (rp = -0.730) was correlated inversely to the membrane fouling resistance significantly. The total EPS (rp = 0.898) and protein (rp = 0.810) had strong positive effect on membrane fouling resistance, but carbohydrate (rp = 0.626) had a moderate correlation with membrane fouling resistance due to its low amounts. SMP (rp = 0.757), SSs (rp = 0.810), dynamic viscosity (rp = 0.691), RH (rp = 0.837), and zeta potential (rp = -0.881) also had significant influence on membrane permeability. However, protein (rp = 0.936), SMP (rp = 0.725), SSs (rp = 0.783), dynamic viscosity (rp = 0.633), RH (rp = 0.877), and zeta potential (rp = -0.953) mainly resulted from the change of EPS concentration. These results confirm that MLSS concentration, PSD and EPS were the predominant factors affecting membrane fouling during membrane filtration of sludge suspension. The membrane fouling resistance can be predicted using a simple model based on MLSS concentration, PSD and EPS. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A tool is developed for the validation of membrane fouling: the Membrane Fouling Simulator (MFS). The MFS uses the same materials as spiral wound reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes, has similar dimensions and hydrodynamic behaviour and is equipped with a sight glass. Using the MFS, fouling can be monitored by: (1) operational parameters like pressure drop, (2) non-destructive (visual and microscopic) observations using the window and (3) analysis of coupons sampled from the membrane sheet in the MFS. The major advantages of the MFS are: (i) representativeness of spiral wound membranes and (ii) the small size requiring small amounts of water and chemicals, reducing research costs and enhancing the possibility to test several MFS units in parallel. The MFS can be applied for early warning, characterization of the fouling potential of feed water, comparison of different pre-treatment schemes and for evaluation of fouling control applying different chemicals. The MFS can be used in model studies to develop integrated membrane systems less susceptible to fouling. The MFS is a suited tool for testing newly developed membranes. The first MFS tests showed that the results are representative for membranes used in practice under the same operating conditions. A comparison study of the MFS and spiral wound membrane modules showed the same pressure drop development in time and the same fouling accumulation. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A robust artificial neural network (ANN) model requiring minimal training, closely predicted membrane fouling during nanofiltration (NF) of ground and surface water. Neural networks accurately simulated the total resistance to water permeation across NF membranes during bench-scale experiments with flat membrane sheets, tests with single spiral-wound elements, as well as pilot- and full-scale tests with multiple spiral-wound elements arranged in two stages. ANN inputs included physically meaningful and independent variables including flow rates and feed water quality parameters (pH, UV254, and total dissolved solids (TDS)) that are commonly monitored during water treatment thereby facilitating their implementation. Therefore, under the experimental conditions investigated, colloidal fouling and biofouling appeared to be negligible because accurate ANN predictions were possible without using feed water turbidity and bacteria concentrations as inputs. One emphasis during this work was to minimize the data employed for ANN training while simultaneously performing simulations in purely predictive mode for entire cycles (experiments). Cumulatively, using only 10{\%} of experimental data for ANN training allowed prediction of 93{\%} of them with {\textless}5{\%} absolute relative error. Hence, simple to implement ANNs are capable of capturing changes in feed water quality, flux, and recovery and can successfully overcome difficulties associated with mechanistic models to accurately predict long-term fouling during municipal drinking water nanofiltration. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The 3D mathematical model showed the same trends for (i) feed channel pressure drop, (ii) biomass accumulation, (iii) velocity distribution profile, resulting in regions of low and high liquid flow velocity also named channeling. The numerical model predicted a dominant biomass growth on the feed spacer, consistent with direct in situ observations on biofouling of spiral wound membrane modules and monitors using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

abstract = {The observation of inhomogeneous radial distributions of particles in tube flow dates from the work of Poiseuille (1836) who was mainly concerned by the flow of blood and the behavior of the red and white corpuscles it carries. These results were then generalized to non-biological flows and experiments on pipe flow of suspensions also indicated that significant deviations from ideal Poiseuilleflow could occur in the presence of particles. We will consider systems where the fluid flow in the absence of particles is unidirectional. We will first present how fluid-particle interactions can induce lateral migration in the case of a single rigid particle in a shear flow, as a,function of the Reynolds number. While the focus is upon inertial migration, a brief discussion of lateral migration in polymeric and viscoelastic fluids, where the nonlinearity results from the non-Newtonian behavior of the suspending fluid, will be presented at the conclusion of this Section. The role of interparticle interactions in a sheared fluid will be considered in the third section in the case of Stokes flow. The last section will briefly present how sedimentation can affect lateral motion.},

abstract = {Optimisation of ultrafiltration pilot plants requires a better knowledge of membrane fouling. In the field of drinking water production, phenoraena involved in fouling are very complex and interdependent because of the numerous compounds contained in raw waters. As no knowledge model is available for this application, a statisti- cal modelling tool called neural network is used in this paper to predict the total hydraulic resistance at the end of a filtration cycle and after next backwash, using some parameters concerning water quality (turbidity and tem- perature) and operating conditions, for a given experimental site. Different network structures have been evalu- ated, using information concernin{\~{}} the current filtration cycle and the previous cycle. Some of them allow a pre- diction of resistance with a very good accuracy. They take into account as network inlets the permeate flow rate, pressure and water turbidity, and are able to model the effects of reversible fouling on resistance.},

abstract = {Many food products can be categorized as emulsion gels. This is especially the case for protein-based oil-in-water emulsions which can be converted into soft-solid-like materials by common food processing operations such as heating, acidification, and enzyme action. This review article outlines how the rheological and structural properties of protein-stabilized emulsion gels are influenced by the dispersed oil volume fraction, the oil–water interfacial composition, and the colloidal interactions of the constituent emulsion droplets. For model systems of variable oil content and containing different food proteins, some general trends of rheological behaviour at small and large deformations are identified. Experimental rigidity data are considered in relation to: (i) material science theories of the reinforcement of solid materials by active and inactive filler particles, and (ii) Brownian dynamics simulations of aggregated particle networks containing bonded and non-bonded particles. Influences of interfacial composition and particle–matrix interactions on microstructure and rheology are explained with particular reference to the role of small-molecule surfactants. Compositional and structural factors affecting the large-deformation rheology and fracture properties are described. Finally, the practical relevance of the model system studies to the behaviour of real food products is critically assessed.},

@article{Bauza2006,
abstract = {This paper presents the development of a real-time, contact-based, high frequency, response profilometer employed as a roundness gauge for measuring circular form error for 100{\%} part inspection on the shop floor with an accuracy of better than 0.5 $\mu$m with measurement times of less than 1 s. The gauge head is a closed-loop controlled mechanism comprising a contact force probe that is rigidly attached to a high bandwidth linear translator. The gauge head assembly is, in turn, attached to a precision spindle. The objective of the complete tool is to contact the sidewall of the circular feature, translate the probe tip to produce a defined contact force with the workpiece and rotate the gauge head assembly. During rotation of the spindle, this contact force is maintained at a nominally constant value by dynamically translating the force probe along a radial direction to follow surface deviations. The gauge head assembly (including force probe and servo drive) has a fundamental mode natural frequency of 330 Hz while scanning the workpiece with a constant contact force typically less than 100 mN. Form error (deviation from a nominal circle) is measured using a capacitance-based displacement sensor measuring the relative radial displacement of the probe with the spindle rotating at a constant rotation speed. This paper discusses the design and characterization of this metrology tool. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Mathematical expressions for filtration resistances like cake layer forming and fouling are presented and combined with an activated sludge model (ASM) to describe the biological treatment processes.

The effects of stylus size, scan size and sampling interval on roughness parameters are investigated. The methodology of choosing the scan size and sampling interval is suggested. AFM is concluded to be the most suitable surface measuring instrument for roughness measurement on the glass-ceramic substrate. If SP is used to make the measurement, the tip radius should be in the order of 0.2 mu m. However, localized damage to the test surface may occur owing to high contact stress. NOP using an objective magnification of 40 or lower is not recommended because the glass-ceramic substrate contains submicron roughness.},

abstract = {The immiscibility of canola oil in methanol provides a mass-transfer challenge in the early stages of the transesterification of canola oil in the production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME or biodiesel). To overcome or rather, exploit this situation, a two-phase membrane reactor was developed to produce FAME from canola oil and methanol. The transesterification of canola oil was performed via both acid- or base-catalysis. Runs were performed in the membrane reactor in semi-batch mode at 60, 65 and 70 ??C and at different catalyst concentrations and feed flow rates. Increases in temperature, catalyst concentration and feedstock (methanol/oil) flow rate significantly increased the conversion of oil to biodiesel. The novel reactor enabled the separation of reaction products (FAME/glycerol in methanol) from the original canola oil feed. The two-phase membrane reactor was particularly useful in removing unreacted canola oil from the FAME product yielding high purity biodiesel and shifting the reaction equilibrium to the product side. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recent advancements and some emerging trends in the methods and instruments used for surface and near surface characterisation are presented, considering the measurement of both topography and physical properties. In particular, surfaces that present difficulties in measurement or require new procedures are considered, with emphasis on measurements approaching the nanometre scale. Examples of new instruments and promising innovations for roughness measurement and surface integrity characterisation are presented. The new needs for tolerancing, traceability and calibration are also addressed.},

@article{Picioreanu2000,
abstract = {A two-dimensional model for quantitative evaluation of the effect of convective and diffusive substrate transport on biofilm heterogeneity was developed. The model includes flow computation around the irregular biofilm surface, substrate mass transfer by convection and diffusion, biomass growth, and biomass spreading. It was found that in the absence of detachment, biofilm heterogeneity is mainly determined by internal mass transfer rate of substrates and by the initial percentage of carrier-surface colonization. Model predictions show that biofilm structures with highly irregular surface develop in the mass transfer-limited regime. As the nutrient availability increases, there is a gradual shift toward compact and smooth biofilms. A smaller fraction of colonized carrier surface leads to a patchy biofilm. Biofilm surface irregularity and deep vertical channels are, in this case, caused by the inability of the colonies to spread over the whole substratum surface. The maximum substrate flux to the biofilm was greatly influenced by both internal and external mass transfer rates, but not affected by the inoculation density. In general, results of the present model were similar to those obtained by a simple diffusion-reaction-growth model.},

@article{Smets,
abstract = {Although studied extensively, modeling fouling phenomena in membrane bioreactors (MBRs) remains challenging. It has been well established that cake layer formation and pore blocking have a strong impact on the filtration performance but how to capture that in comprehensive models is not fully defined yet. Since it has been shown that bioflocculation characteristics of activated sludge have a clear link with (the extent of) membrane fouling, this study integrates activated sludge floc size (i.e., particle size distribution) information in the model for pore blocking and cake layer formation with a focus on constant flux operated MBRs. Based on these floc size distributions, a three-dimensional modeling and visualization of the cake layer is envisaged which can then provide the required input information (e.g., the porosity of the cake layer) for the fouling model. The model is calibrated and validated on the basis of experimental data from Hwang et al. (2012) in ‘Membrane bioreactor: TMP rise and characterization of biocake structure using CLSM-image analysis' (see J. Membr. Sci. 419–420, 33–41).},
